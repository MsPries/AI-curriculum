# AI-curriculum

#### Introduction
This repo contains the curriculum as it was taught for Applied Math and Artificial Intelligence '17-'18. This class was offered as a project based class for high school seniors with and without a background in calculus. I have structured the materials here as a resource for other educators, however it may be of interest to students of all stripes. Normally, the class met twice per week for 45 minutes and offered 45 minutes of homework per class meeting. I ordered the projects based on how I taught them, however, you will notice it is an imperfect progression. I have included some facilitation notes knowing YMMV.

Use this README as an overview for the various projects offered. Where appropriate, further resources are available in the sub-directories of this repo.

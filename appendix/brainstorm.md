# Final Projects Brainstorm

This activity pushed the students to exercise creativity in their approach to their final project topics. Rather than generate feasible project ideas, I wanted students to recognize that AI can impact every field and prompt them to grapple with some interesting questions (and have fun with each other!).

An example interesting project that came out of this came from a student whose choice of a random word was "bum." The student came up with a project idea to automatically analyze music videos to detect bums to provide quantitative data to the conversation around the hypersexualization of women in the media -- awesome!

#### First, I had them fill out this "mad-libs" style prompt when they first walked in. I gave them zero context.

1.	A famous person I like: __________________________________
2.	A random word: ________________________________________
3.	The senior superlative I’d be most proud to receive: _____________________________
4.	Something I like that not very many people like: _____________________________
5.	Something I like that a lot of other people like too: ____________________________
6.	An issue I think is important: ______________________________________________

#### Next, they filled in the numbered blanks below and thought of an example for each prompt in the "My Answer" slot (I gave them a little over five minutes for this). They then rotated papers around the table and were challenged to fill in a blank title for each classmate's paper. We rotated every minute.
